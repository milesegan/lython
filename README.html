<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  Lython is a new lisp front-end for the Python programming language.
  It resembles common lisp and compiles directly to Python bytecodes and 
  transparently integrates with existing Python code and libraries.
</p>
<p>
  It currently provides a very limited macro system.  It is hoped that
  it will one day support full-blown lisp procedural macros.
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    This is a very early proof of concept release and is in no way ready
    for real production use.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
  Just unpack the source and run the lython executable.  If you relocate the
  lython executable you must make sure that the spark.py library is on Python's
  load path.
</p>
<p>
  Try running ./lython tests/operators for a start.
</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>
  Lython depends heavily on the John Aycock's excellent 
  <a href='http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/spark/'>Spark</a> parser
  generation toolkit.
